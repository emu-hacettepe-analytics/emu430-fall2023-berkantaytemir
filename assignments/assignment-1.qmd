# Assignment 1

# (a) 

I was watching this video :<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPk0YEKhqB8&list=PLqzoL9-eJTNBDdKgJgJzaQcY6OXmsXAHU&index=4>. It shows us how to take datas from an excel sheet. Basically to take the excel data , we need to convert the excel data into CSV ( Comma Seperated Values) or txt so that we can assign the datas by using this format :

data1 \<- read.csv(file.choose() , reader = TRUE or False by taking the capital )

and the R immediately opens a interface for you to choose the direction of the data. Afterwards you can call this data by only writing data1.

Also you we can use read.table or read.delim according to taken datas class.
