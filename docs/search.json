    "text": "I was watching this video :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPk0YEKhqB8&list=PLqzoL9-eJTNBDdKgJgJzaQcY6OXmsXAHU&index=4. It shows us how to take datas from an excel sheet. Basically to take the excel data , we need to convert the excel data into CSV ( Comma Seperated Values) or txt so that we can assign the datas by using this format :\ndata1 &lt;- read.csv(file.choose() , reader = TRUE or False by taking the capital )\nand the R immediately opens a interface for you to choose the direction of the data. Afterwards you can call this data by only writing data1.\nAlso you we can use read.table or read.delim according to taken datas class.\n\n\nFirst thing I have realized was the difference of the display of python and R . The R has more complex and detailed display compared to the Python. Such as files , plots , packages , connections and background job interfaces.\nSecondly, the syntax is different compared to python. For instance : you can not use the same “=” equality operator in R by “=” there is a difference between them . In R instead of “=” we should use “&lt;-” to provide exact same operation\nLast but not least, Indentation differs. For example imagine you are trying to define a for loop in both programming language. In python the indentation level differs but in R programming the {} usage solves the indentation problem."
